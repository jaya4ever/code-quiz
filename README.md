# About this project
### This is the module challenge 4 given to make the code quiz with the JavaScript Fundamental from scratch without any starter code. In the given Quiz timer is set up to 76 seconds. There are 4 questions given in this quiz. User has to give the right answer in within 76 seconds. One wrong answer can deduct the 15 seconds. At last scores are store in HighScore place and stored in the local storage. This is the one of the challenging challenge so far I am working on it. I have first used basics questions which are not related to JavaScript to test it. Even though this module is challenging but I have learned a lot. It is sharpning my JavaScript skill. There are still a lot to learn but with this challenge I am getting a good push to learn JavaScript language. I am doing lot of google search  and looking at the site like [Mozilla]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "dev.Mozilla") and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/ "w3Schools"). Also I am going through the recording from the NorthWestern boot camp site which our Instructor has taught us.
