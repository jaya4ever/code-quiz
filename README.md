# About this project
### This is a Simple JavaScript Quiz application and this is the module challenge 4. The application is intended to be used as a game with high scores and involves using a timer, arrays, loops, and other fundamentals we are learning in class.  This code quiz application is from scratch without any starter code. In the given Quiz timer is set up to 76 seconds. There are 4 questions given in this quiz. User has to answer all the right answers within 76 seconds. One wrong answer will deduct 15 seconds. When finishing the 4 questions the last score are placed in HighScore place and stored in the local storage. This was one of the most challenging projects so far that I have worked on! I have first used some test questions not related which are not related to JavaScript to test it. Even though this module is challenging but I have learned a lot. Although this was hard it was sharpened my JavaScript skills. There are still a lot to learn but with this challenge I am getting at pushing to Github in small increments in case I make a mistake and able to revert, also to learn the JavaScript language. I am doing lot of reading and studying to help along with asking my Tutor for help and looking at the sites like [Mozilla]( https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "dev.Mozilla") and [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/ "w3Schools"). Also I am going through the recording from the NorthWestern boot camp site which our Instructor has taught us.
